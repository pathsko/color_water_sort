Color Water Sort - Genetic Algorithm Solution
This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook for solving the Color Water Sort puzzle using a genetic algorithm. The project demonstrates the application of metaheuristic techniques to solve a popular puzzle game, where the objective is to sort colors in flasks.

📄 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to apply a genetic algorithm to find optimal or near-optimal solutions for the Color Water Sort game. The algorithm uses selection, crossover, mutation, and elitism to evolve solutions across multiple generations.

Key Features:
Flask configuration encoding for easy manipulation.
A fitness function based on impurity and connectivity of the flasks.
Tournament selection for creating the new population.
Random crossover and mutation for introducing diversity.
Elitism to retain the best solution found during evolution.
🚀 Getting Started
To run the Jupyter Notebook, you will need:

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
Dependencies listed in the notebook (such as NumPy and Matplotlib)
You can clone the repository and open the notebook locally or directly upload it to Google Colab.
