# Color Water Sort - Genetic Algorithm Solution

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook for solving the **Color Water Sort** puzzle using a **genetic algorithm**. The project demonstrates the application of metaheuristic techniques to solve a popular puzzle game, where the objective is to sort colors in flasks.

## ðŸ“„ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to apply a genetic algorithm to find optimal or near-optimal solutions for the Color Water Sort game. The algorithm uses selection, crossover, mutation, and elitism to evolve solutions across multiple generations.

### Key Features:
- Flask configuration encoding for easy manipulation.
- A fitness function based on impurity and connectivity of the flasks.
- Tournament selection for creating the new population.
- Random crossover and mutation for introducing diversity.
- Elitism to retain the best solution found during evolution.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To run the Jupyter Notebook, you will need:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
- Dependencies listed in the notebook (such as NumPy and Matplotlib)

You can clone the repository and open the notebook locally or directly upload it to Google Colab.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pathsko/color_water_sort.git
```
## ðŸ“ˆ Results

The notebook includes several tests demonstrating the algorithm's performance on different configurations of the Color Water Sort game. In all cases, the algorithm successfully found the optimal solution.
